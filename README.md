# Light-Curves-for-URAP-Sp2022
Code for plotting light curves from periodic brightness data.
I am working on finding binary quasars using periodic light curve data obtained from the Dark Energy Survey and and the Sloan digital sky survey.
This code was written with the help of the grad student supervising me, Tony Chen. 
The original and more comprehensive code written by Tony Chen can be found here https://github.com/xyz3919/SBHB_Analysis
This code is basically plotting data and fitting a function to it using curve_fit.
