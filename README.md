# Light-Curves-for-URAP-Sp2022
Code for plotting light curves from periodic brightness data.
I am working on finding binary quasars using periodic light curve data obtained from the Dark Energy Survey and and the Sloan digital sky survey.
This code was written with the help of the grad student supervising me, Tony Chen.
